My first project on in Udacity's front end developer program.

This project was a bit of a challenge for me becuase to make a responsive site without the help of bootstrap
is something I've never done.

I feel much more confident using grid now as well. Grid use to be a complex topic for me but now i see it's usefulness.

With the combination of media queries and CSS grid I feel more confident building or edititng web apps.
